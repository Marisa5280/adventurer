# Adventurer Alchemist - D&D Character Generator

Welcome to Adventurer Alchemist, a Single Page Application (SPA) built with Create React App that allows you to generate randomized Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) characters using the DND5E API. This web app lets you create characters on the fly, save your favorite character sheets, and revisit them later.

## Features

- **Randomized Character Generation:** Click the "Generate Character" button to create a new, randomized D&D character. Explore various combinations of races, classes, and backgrounds.

- **Save and View Character Sheets:** Save the characters you like by clicking the "Save Character" button. You can later view and revisit your saved character sheets.

- **Persistent Storage:** Your saved characters are stored locally, so even if you close the browser or come back later, your characters will still be available.

- **End-to-End Testing with Cypress:** The application has been thoroughly tested using Cypress for end-to-end (E2E) testing to ensure a smooth user experience.
